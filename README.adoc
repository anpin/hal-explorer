= HAL Explorer

With HAL Explorer you can browse and explore http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL]
and https://rwcbook.github.io/hal-forms/[HAL-FORMS] based RESTful Hypermedia APIs.
HAL Explorer was inspired by Mike Kelly's https://github.com/mikekelly/hal-browser[HAL-Browser].
HAL Explorer also supports Spring Profiles.

* API URL, theme, layout and request headers stored in URL fragment
* Support for Spring Data Rest profiles to populate properties in request editor
* Support for HAL-FORMS (_templates) to populate properties in request editor and to provide only supported HTTP methods for self link


== Demo

You can play with the latest snapshot version of HAL Explorer in running demos:

* For HAL: https://chatty42.herokuapp.com/hal-explorer/index.html#theme=Cosmo&url=https://chatty42.herokuapp.com/api[Chatty API].
* For HAL-FORMS: http://hypermedia-movies-demo.herokuapp.com/hal-explorer/index.html#theme=Cosmo&uri=http://hypermedia-movies-demo.herokuapp.com/api/movies/1[Movies API]

I host this demos at Heroku, so please give them a bit time to warm up (This might take up to 1 minute).

== Development Server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

== Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project in production mode. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

== Gradle/Java Build Support

If you have Java installed, you can also build the project with Gradle. The Gradle build will install node.js locally in the project directory.
Run `./gradlew build` to build the project in production mode. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

== Integration in your Backends

If you want to use a released version of HAL Explorer in a Java based project, you could define a dependency to the HAL Explorer WebJar.

Maven:
[source,xml]
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
    <artifactId>hal-explorer</artifactId>
    <version>0.13.0</version>
</dependency>

Gradle:
[source]
compile 'org.webjars:hal-explorer:0.13.0'

When you use the WebJar with Spring Boot, you can access the HAL Explorer at `/webjars/hal-explorer/0.13.0/index.html`.
The easiest way to integrate the upstream version of HAL Explorer into your backend would be to clone this Git repo,
do a production build and then copy the content of the dist folder to a location accessible by your backend server. When you use Spring Boot, a good location in your projects source tree would be src/main/java/resources/static/hal-explorer. See https://github.com/toedter/chatty for a concrete integration example.

== Running Tests

Run `yarn test` to run the unit test suite against your default browser,
run `yarn test-headless` to run the unit test suite against headless Chrome.

To run the e2e tests you must have Docker installed.
The e2e tests start a real Spring Boot based backend in a Docker container which is then used by HAL Explorer.
Run `yarn e2e` to run the e2e test suite against your default browser,
run `yarn e2e-headless` to run the e2e test suite against headless Chrome.

Take a look at `package.json` for more test options.
